  "StallMarketGovernor -- the independent compliance layer that earns
  the StallMarketAdvisor the right to commit. The advisor has no notion
  of whether a market stall is actually registered and permit-verified,
  whether a named supply-order vendor is itself a registered/verified
  counterparty, whether its own proposed `:effect` secretly claims a
  direct actuation instead of a mere proposal, or whether it has silently
  drifted into a permanently out-of-scope decision area, so this MUST be
  a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall back to HOLD.

  This actor's scope is deliberately narrow -- COORDINATION ONLY
  (inventory/sale data logging, stall placement/staffing scheduling,
  textile/clothing/footwear supply-order coordination, quality-concern
  flagging). It NEVER performs or authorizes:
    - setting or overriding a unit price
    - directly finalizing a quality-dispute resolution (issuing a refund
      or replacement, voiding a sale, charging back a vendor, revoking or
      terminating a vendor's registration/contract, or otherwise
      declaring a quality dispute resolved)
    - directly finalizing a counterfeit-authenticity determination
      (declaring an item counterfeit, certifying an item as genuine, or
      otherwise resolving an authenticity claim)
    - quality-dispute-resolution or counterfeit-authenticity-resolution
      authority (accepting/denying liability on the stall operator's
      behalf, instructing a vendor's account be closed)

  Four HARD checks, ALL permanent, un-overridable by any human approval:

    1. Stall unverified           -- the target market stall record must
                                     exist AND be independently confirmed
                                     `:registered?`/`:verified?` (a
                                     registered, permit-verified stall/
                                     market pitch) before ANY proposal for
                                     it may commit or even escalate. Never
                                     trusts a proposal's own claim about
                                     the stall -- re-derived from the
                                     stall's own record, the same 'ground
                                     truth, not self-report' discipline
                                     every sibling actor's governor uses.
    2. Vendor unverified          -- for `:coordinate-supply-order` ONLY,
                                     the proposal's own drafted `:value`
                                     must name a `:vendor-id` that
                                     resolves to an independently
                                     `:registered?`/`:verified?` vendor
                                     (textile/clothing/footwear
                                     manufacturer/wholesaler/distributor)
                                     record. A missing vendor-id, or one
                                     that resolves to an unregistered or
                                     unverified vendor, is a HARD block.
    3. Effect not :propose        -- every proposal's `:effect` MUST be
                                     `:propose`. Any other effect value
                                     is, by construction, a claim to
                                     directly actuate/commit outside
                                     governance -- HARD block, not merely
                                     low-confidence.
    4. Scope exclusion            -- ANY proposal (regardless of op)
                                     whose op, summary, rationale, cites
                                     or draft value touches directly
                                     finalizing a quality-dispute
                                     resolution (issuing a refund or
                                     replacement, voiding a sale,
                                     charging back a vendor, revoking or
                                     terminating a vendor's registration/
                                     contract) OR directly finalizing a
                                     counterfeit-authenticity
                                     determination (declaring an item
                                     counterfeit, certifying an item as
                                     genuine, resolving an authenticity
                                     claim) is a HARD, PERMANENT block --
                                     this actor's charter excludes that
                                     territory structurally, not as a
                                     rollout milestone. Evaluated
                                     UNCONDITIONALLY on every proposal. An
                                     op outside the closed four-op
                                     allowlist is the SAME failure mode
                                     (an advisor proposing something it
                                     was never authorized to propose) and
                                     is folded into this same check.
                                     `:flag-quality-concern` itself is
                                     never excluded by this check --
                                     surfacing a suspected-counterfeit/
                                     defective-goods/permit concern for a
                                     human is exactly this actor's job;
                                     only FINALIZING/resolving/
                                     determining/actuating on that concern
                                     is excluded (see
                                     `scope-excluded-terms` below --
                                     phrased as the finalization/execution
                                     ACTION, never a bare noun like
                                     'refund', 'dispute', 'counterfeit' or
                                     'permit', so the default mock
                                     advisor's own `:flag-quality-concern`
                                     rationale never self-trips this
                                     check).

  Two ESCALATE (SOFT) gates, either forces human sign-off:
    - LLM confidence below the floor.
    - The op is `:flag-quality-concern` -- ALWAYS escalates to a human,
      regardless of confidence, regardless of how clean the proposal
      otherwise is. `stallops.phase` independently agrees:
      `:flag-quality-concern` is never a member of any phase's `:auto`
      set either -- two layers, not one.
    - A `:coordinate-supply-order` whose drafted `:value` names an
      `:estimated-cost` above `supply-cost-threshold` -- a large-value
      textile/clothing/footwear procurement proposal always needs a
      human sign-off, even when the governor and phase would otherwise
      allow auto-commit."
